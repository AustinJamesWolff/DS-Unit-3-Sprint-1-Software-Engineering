## Module 2 Project - Object-Oriented Programming, Code Style and Reviews

_Code that works_ is good - _code that other people can read_ is better.

## Learning Objectives
* Create a basic Python class, with a constructor, methods, and fields
* Write stylistic (PEP 8) Python code, and give and receive a basic code review

## Before Lecture
Read the [official Python Class tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html), and try to reproduce the examples in your own Python environment.

Skim the [PEP 8 style guide](https://pep8.org/), and then look back at code you've written in the past. Identify at least three times you did something the style guide says you shouldn't, and write a corrected version.
