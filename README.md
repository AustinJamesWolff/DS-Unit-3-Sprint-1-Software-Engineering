## The World Beyond Notebooks

Python Notebooks are great - they let us explore data and communicate and share
results. But if you want to write more general-purpose reusable code, you should
put it in a *package* - like numpy, pandas, and the other great tools we depend
on.

A full production-grade library is a large undertaking, but this week we will
build our own modest but still useful package with utility functions for common
data science tasks. Behold, **lambdata**!
